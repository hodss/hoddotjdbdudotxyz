          Hello, World, I'm hod
          <br /><br />
          I'm a full stack developer, my primary tools and languages are
          Node.js, Php, JavaScript, Lua, and of course, I use a lot of vanilla
          HTML/CSS <br />I feel like a lot of things are overcompilcated in the
          web development space, a lot of CSS frameworks and specialized ways to
          write HTML, my goal is to learn more, and try to teach others things I
          learn along the way. I also enjoy working with Bash, Linux, and
          cybersecurity. I am currently an Adminstrator/Partner and Developer at
          <a href="https://jdbdu.xyz">jdbdu</a> and a CodeTrainer Developer as
          well, a product of jdbdu. In addition to that, I am a
          <a href="https://jusoft.dev/">JuSoft</a> Developer. Open source
          technology is something that I love to work on. <br />
          I am generally a friendly person as long as you are nice, I also enjoy
          some games occassionally. My favorite game of all time is Titanfall 2,
          I also sometimes play ROBLOX as I like to use it as a lightweight game
          development engine, that's where I learned what I know about Lua from.
          <br />
          I am always open to commissions, I make cheap portfolio websites sorta
          like this one but with more content if you'd like for around 5
          dollars, this includes a domain under 3 dollars for a year, as long as
          you pay me via crypto. If you'd like to commission me or get me to
          develop something for you, send me an email at hod@jdbdu.xyz, or DM me
          on Discord via the CodeTrainer
          <a href="https://discord.com/invite/tVgkzJagsh">Discord</a> <br />
          If you'd like to donate to me, and NonZeroCornet, my partner in jdbdu,
          make sure to head to the jdbdu
